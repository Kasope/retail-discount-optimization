# Retail discount optimization
A data-driven analysis of discount strategies for a U.S. supermarket chain, identifying optimal pricing approaches that balance customer acquisition with profitability. This project demonstrates strategic use of business intelligence tools to solve real-world retail challenges.
## Key Achievement: 
Identified discount optimization strategies that could increase profit margins from 12% to 18% without sacrificing sales volume.
## Business Problem
Retail supermarkets face a critical challenge: while discounts attract customers, excessive discounting erodes profit margins. This analysis addresses:

* What is the relationship between discount level and profit margin?
* Which product categories benefit most from discounting?
* How do geographic differences influence discount effectiveness?

## Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roopacalistus/superstore/data)
* **Size:** 9,994 sales transactions
* **Scope:** Multiple U.S. stores across different regions
* **Key Variables:** Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, Sub-category, Region, State, Quantity

## Tools and Technologies

* **Microsoft Power BI:** Data visualization and analysis
* **Data Analysis:** Segmentation, calculated fields, KPI development
* **Business Intelligence:** Dashboard design and stakeholder reporting

## Key Findings
### 1. Category Performance

* **Technology:** Maintains strong margins (15-20%) with moderate discounts due to high price sensitivity
* **Furniture:** Suffers from excessive discounting (18% average) - reducing unnecessary sales volume
* **Office Supplies:** Shows minimal response to discounts - customers purchase regardless

### 2. Geographic Insights

* **Top Performers:** California, New York, Washington maintain healthy margins with modest discounts
* **Risk States:** Several states show negative profits at 25%+ discount levels
* **Regional Patterns:** All regions profit most from 0-10% discount ranges

### 3. Critical Thresholds

* **Optimal Range:** 0-10% discounts generate consistent profitability across all regions
* **Caution Zone:** 15-20% discounts work only for specific products in Western region
* **Loss Zone:** 25%+ discounts consistently generate losses and should be eliminated

## Strategic Recommendations
### Immediate Actions

* **Eliminate 25%+ discounts:** Stop all deep discounting immediately
* **Cap Furniture discounts** at 8-10% (down from 18%)
* **Minimize Office Supplies discounts:** demand is price-inelastic
* **Maintain Technology discounts** at moderate levels for price-sensitive customers

### Regional Strategy

* Implement California's successful discount model across other states
* Customize discount levels based on regional performance data
* Deploy an automated monitoring system for real-time optimization

### Expected Impact
 
* **Profit Margin Increase:** 12% → 18% (+50% improvement)
* **Sales Volume:** Maintained at current levels
* **Strategic Positioning:** Data-driven pricing vs. blanket discounting
